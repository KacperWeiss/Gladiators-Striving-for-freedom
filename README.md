Gladiators: Striving for freedom

This is version 0.1.0
This version is unbalanced (player should get more Experience after battle, there should be more data on the screen and more items/enemies added)

Graphics used in project are open source and from websites listed below:

It's simple RPG game, which I started as a project for a programing course, but after further development it can become fun little game.
Goal is simple -> defeat master of the arena and get your freedom.
